##  Start Here

### Choose your language:

1. **Node.js** → Go to `part-1-base-application/nodejs/`

##  How to Use This Workshop

1. **Read each README.md** in order  
2. **Type the code yourself** (avoid copy/paste!)  
3. **Run and test** every step  
4. **Inspect results in SigNoz**  
5. **Experiment** by tweaking the code  

**Tip:** Typing code by hand helps you remember it better!
