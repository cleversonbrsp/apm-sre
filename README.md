#  SRE Study Guide: Understanding Requests & Observability

Welcome to the **SRE Study Guide**!  
This repository is designed to help you progressively learn about HTTP requests, APIs, load balancing, observability, and SRE best practices.  
By the end of this guide, you will be able to monitor requests with **SigNoz** and apply this knowledge in your career as an SRE.

##  Learning Outcomes
After completing this study guide, you will be able to:
- Understand how HTTP requests and responses work.  
- Compare REST, gRPC, and GraphQL.  
- Configure load balancers for efficient request routing.  
- Apply the three pillars of observability (metrics, logs, traces).  
- Use **SigNoz** for application performance monitoring (APM).  
- Apply SRE best practices to handle requests in microservices and monolithic architectures.

##  Labs

### Lab 1: Node.js Application with OpenTelemetry & SigNoz

**Get hands-on experience with a complete Node.js application!**

The lab includes:
-  Complete e-commerce API with user registrations, orders, and payments
-  OpenTelemetry instrumentation for traces and custom metrics
-  Docker Compose setup for easy deployment
-  SigNoz integration for visualization
-  Ready-to-run code with no complex setup

**Quick Start:**
1. Follow the instructions in [labs/01.md](labs/01.md)
2. Run `docker-compose up --build`
3. Access your instrumented app at http://localhost:3000
4. View traces and metrics in SigNoz at http://localhost:3301

**Perfect for:**
- Learning OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Understanding distributed tracing
- Practicing custom metrics creation
- Setting up APM with SigNoz
