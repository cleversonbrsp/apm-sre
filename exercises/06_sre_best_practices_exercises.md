# Exercises â€“ Chapter 6: SRE Best Practices in Handling Requests

1. Design a **retry strategy** for a microservice request. Which backoff policy would you use (fixed, exponential, jitter)?  
2. Compare how **observability differs** in monolithic vs. microservices architectures.  
3. Write an example of a **graceful degradation plan** for a search service.  
4. Create a **checklist** for monitoring HTTP requests in production environments.  
5. Bonus: Define an **SLO** for an e-commerce checkout service (latency and error rate).
