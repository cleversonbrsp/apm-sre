# Exercises â€“ Chapter 2: REST vs gRPC vs GraphQL

1. Convert the REST request `GET /users/42` into a GraphQL query.  
2. Compare REST and gRPC for a **chat application** that requires very high throughput. Which one would you choose and why?  
3. Explain a scenario where GraphQL is more efficient than REST.  
4. Identify benefits and drawbacks of using gRPC versus REST in a microservices architecture.  
5. Bonus: Design a small API (choose REST, gRPC, or GraphQL) for a library system (books, authors, borrowers).
